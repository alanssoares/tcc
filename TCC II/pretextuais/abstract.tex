The need for automation and construction of robotic agents capable of performing complex tasks, 
dangerous, delicate in dynamic environments, it has become a challenge for researchers. Some of 
these challenges include mapping of dynamic environments, path planning and collision prediction. 
This work proposes a model for mapping and path planning with collision prediction for 
robotic agents in a simulated environment. The model was developed using the BahiaRT team base, 
developed by the research group ACSO / UNEB in partnership with FCPortugal (FEUP-LIACC/Univ. Aveiro). 
The validation of the project was performed using an application of the pass in robotic soccer 
integrated in the proposed model.

\textbf{Key-words}: Mapping. Path planning. Navigation. Prediction. Simulation 3D.
