    The RoboCup 3D simulation league is an international competition in which
    autonomous simulated humanoid robots play soccer against each other in a 
    physically realistic environment.  This report presents the architecture,
    design decisions, and components of the UT Austin Villa 2011 RoboCup 3D
    simulation league team.  Important components include an omnidirectional walk
    engine and associated walk parameter optimization framework, an inverse
    kinematics based kicking architecture, and a dynamic role and formation
    positioning system.  UT Austin Villa won the RoboCup 2011 3D simulation
    competition, consisting of 22 teams from 12 different countries, in 
    convincing fashion by winning all 24 games it played.  During the course of
    the competition the team scored 136 goals while conceding none.
